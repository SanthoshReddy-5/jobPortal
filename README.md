# Job Portal Application (Learning Project)

This repository contains the source code for a **Job Portal Application** that I'm building as part of my learning journey in **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **MySQL** and modern web technologies such as **Drizzle ORM**,**React-Hook-Form**, **Zod**, **TipTap**,..etc. I am following along with the tutorials from the **Thapa Technical** YouTube channel, where I learn and implement new concepts daily.

The goal of this project is to learn full-stack web development using real-world concepts. I am building this application step-by-step from scratch and updating it as I complete each topic covered in the series.

> **Note:** This project is currently **under development** and will be evolving over time as I continue learning.
